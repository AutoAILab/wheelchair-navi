# wheelchair-navi repo

The repository has the files and informatimn needed to perform autonomous navigation for a wheelchair using a ZED2i camera in simulation using the Nvidia Isaac Sim tool and on a real robot.

The folder "Omniverse" contains the necessary information to set up the wheelchair simulation in Isaac Sim.

# Demo video

Autonomous wheelchair simulation and demo in:
- Nvidia-Isaac
- ROS and navigation test in the CU-ICAR Lab.
